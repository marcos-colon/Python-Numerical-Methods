# Python-Numerical-Methods
Exercises from book "Python Programming and Numerical Methods" 

This repository is an ongoing project where I work the end of chapter exercises from the book "Python Programming and Numerical Methods". 
I may also add summary of some of the concepts in the chapters. 

You can find the book in https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html
